🏏 Cricket Match Simulator
Cricket Match Simulator is a stylish, interactive web application built using Spring Boot, Web MVC,Spring Data JPA, JSP, and modern HTML/CSS, designed to simulate a real-life cricket match experience in a fun, virtual way. The project focuses on providing a complete flow — from player registration to toss, match simulation, and displaying match results — all wrapped in a modern, sporty, glassmorphism-inspired UI.

🚀 Features
✅ Player Registration:
Register players with their names and team (RCB/CSK). Validates input and stores it in the database.

✅ Toss Simulation:
Simulates a real coin toss where the user selects Head or Tail and picks their team. The system randomly decides the toss result and announces the toss winner with stylish visuals.

✅ Team Selection:
Automatically sets the opponent team based on toss result. Displays toss outcome in a vibrant, neon-themed scoreboard style.

✅ Match Start & Play:
Starts the match simulation once teams are set. Simulates a simple match scenario (can be extended with more complex logic later).

✅ Result Display:
Shows match result in a clean, digital scoreboard style page.

✅ Responsive Modern UI:
Fully responsive front-end with Orbitron scoreboard font, glassmorphism cards, radial gradient backgrounds, cricket icons, and smooth animations. Gives a real stadium vibe.

✅ Clean Codebase:
Built with Spring Boot MVC, clean controllers, service classes, and simple JSP pages. Easy to extend and maintain.
